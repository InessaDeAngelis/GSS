#### Data expectations ####
# Agreement varies with the statement that men are better suited emotionally for politics than women
# Agreement varies by gender with the statement that men are better suited emotionally for politics than women
# Agreement varies over time with the statement that men are better suited emotionally for politics than women
# Political views vary on a scale from 1-7 from extremely liberal, to moderate, to extremely conservative 
# Party affiliation varies on a scale from 0-7 from strong Democrat, to independent/neutral, to strong Republican
# People with more liberal political views will disagree that men are emotionally better suited for politics than women
# People with more conservative views will agree that men are emotionally better suited for politics than women
